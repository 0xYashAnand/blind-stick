## **Features**
1. Obstacle Detection: The stick alerts the user with a beeping sound when it detects obstacles in front using an ultrasonic distance sensor.

2. Weather Detection: By pressing a button, the device uses temperature and humidity sensors to determine whether it's suitable to go outside, indicated by green or red LEDs and beeping sounds.

3. Pit Detection: The stick identifies pits of a specified depth and warns the user with LED and sound notifications.

4. Road Crossing Mode: Through Google Assistant integration, the stick activates an alarm to alert nearby individuals to assist the user in crossing the road.

5. SOS Message to Rescue: An SOS button sends notifications and emails to relatives in critical situations.

## **Circuit Diagrams**
The repository provides circuit diagrams for various functionalities.

## **Platform Used**
Arduino IDE, IFTTT, Google Assistant V2, Google Home, and Blynk are utilized to code, set up automation, integrate with Google Assistant, and send SOS messages and emails.

## **Conclusion**
The Blind Stick project proves to be a revolutionary and affordable robotic helper for the visually impaired. It enhances their safety, independence, and self-confidence during navigation. While it has advantages like stress reduction and early detection of hazards, limitations like network dependency are considered.

In summary, this repository showcases the development of a powerful and practical assistive device, the Blind Stick, which can greatly improve the lives of visually impaired individuals by providing them with greater autonomy and safety during navigation.
